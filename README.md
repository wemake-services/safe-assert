Allows users to write composable `assert`s that are not stripped away in [optimized mode](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-o).


## Features

- Single simple, pythonic, fast, tested, typed, documented function. That's it!
- Because `safe_assert` is a function, it can be easily composed with other functions
- Fully typed with annotations and checked with mypy, [PEP561 compatible](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0561/)


## Installation

```bash
pip install safe-assert
```


## Examples

The usage is identical to `assert` keyword, but a function:

```python
from safe_assert import safe_assert

def sort_positive_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    safe_assert(all(num >= 0 for num in numbers), 'found negative')
    return sorted(numbers)

sort_positive_numbers([1, 2, 3])  # => will work
sort_positive_numbers([-1, 2, 3])
# => will fail in runtime with `AssertionError`
```

How is it different from regular `assert`?
The major one is that it would not be stripped away with `-O` flag.
So, it still allows to write declarative checks that are safe in production.

The second one is that you can compose it as any other regular function.
Useful in conjunction with [`dry-python`](https://github.com/dry-python) projects.


## Internals

How does it work internally?
It internally raises [`AssertionError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AssertionError) that is also used by the `assert` keyword itself.
